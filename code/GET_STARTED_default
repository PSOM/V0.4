A. If you want a quick start, you can get started quite quickly by following these steps:

* step 1: Please edit the ./optfile to set the compiler you will use:       fcomp=...  (ifort, pgf95 etc.)

* Additional step if you choose to not use netcdf output,
    - edit the file ./optfile          and set define_netcdf to F.
    - edit the file ./model/inc/cppdef and undefine output_netcdf: 
            #define file_output_cdf   by default
            #undef file_output_cdf    if you do not want to use netcdf.

* step 2: sh tools/configure.sh

* step 3: sh tools/compile.sh

* step 4: ./exe/nh < ./namelist

You are done !

Now, some explanations:

* Step 2 will search for makedepend (necessary to create the makefile). The script will stop if makedepend is not installed.
   If you chose to use netcdf, step2 will also search for nc-config. The code has been tested with netcdf4 libraries.
    - if nc-config is present, it will make use of it to get the rights links.
    - if not, you should link yourself by editing the ./optfile before step3.
  Step 2 has two effects:
    - It modifies ./optfile
    - It modifies ./namelist

  To sum up, if step 2 fails, you might have to install makedepend or install netcdf libraries (in case you want to use netcdf output).
  After having done that, repeat step 2. 

* Step 3 will 
    - create the makefile in ./mkfile
    - compile


* Step 4 will start and run the model.
  By default, the output will appear on the screen and the output files will go to ../output/.
  By default, namelist has some values you might want to change. You can of course change these values by editing namelist and repeat step 4.


If you want to customize later your use of the model, you can of course change manually the ./optfile and ./namelist files.
